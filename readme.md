# Ancient Projects

While "Ancient" would be an interesting name for a project, it's used literally: This is old code I wrote way back; some from 2009, some from later, possibly some from even earlier.

I'm currently going through my files and cleaning up; as part of this I'm putting it in this Git repo, mostly to archive it. I don't really intend to do anything with it.
