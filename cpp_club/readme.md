# Code created as part of the C++ Club

I can't tell how much of this code is mine and how much is by Marcus Riemer; it has been too long. Marcus initially lead the C++ Club, supplying some of the code that we then expanded; later I lead the club, at which point all code would be mine.

Either way this code is not representative of what I would write nowadays; some of it is at least as old as 2008.
